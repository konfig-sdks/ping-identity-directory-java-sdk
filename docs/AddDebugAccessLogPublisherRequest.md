|**logFile** | **String** | The file name to use for the log files generated by the Debug Access Log Publisher. The path to the file can be specified either as relative to the server root or as an absolute path. |  |
|**logFilePermissions** | **String** | The UNIX permissions of the log files created by this Debug Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
|**rotationPolicy** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | The rotation policy to use for the Debug Access Log Publisher . |  [optional] |
|**rotationListener** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | A listener that should be notified whenever a log file is rotated out of service. |  [optional] |
|**retentionPolicy** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | The retention policy to use for the Debug Access Log Publisher . |  [optional] |
|**compressionMechanism** | **EnumlogPublisherCompressionMechanismProp** |  |  [optional] |
|**signLog** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the log should be cryptographically signed so that the log content cannot be altered in an undetectable manner. |  [optional] |
|**encryptLog** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether log files should be encrypted so that their content is not available to unauthorized users. |  [optional] |
|**encryptionSettingsDefinitionID** | **String** | Specifies the ID of the encryption settings definition that should be used to encrypt the data. If this is not provided, the server&#39;s preferred encryption settings definition will be used.

|**obscureSensitiveContent** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the resulting log file should attempt to obscure content that may be considered sensitive. This primarily includes the credentials for bind requests, the values of password modify extended requests and responses, and the values of any attributes specified in the obscure-attribute property. Note that the use of this option does not guarantee no sensitive information will be exposed, so the log output should still be carefully guarded. |  [optional] |
|**obscureAttribute** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | Specifies the names of any attribute types that should have their values obscured if the obscure-sensitive-content property has a value of true. |  [optional] |

|**logRequests** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to log information about requests received from clients. |  [optional] |
|**logResults** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to log information about the results of client requests. |  [optional] |
|**logIntermediateResponses** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to log information about intermediate responses sent to the client. |  [optional] |
|**suppressInternalOperations** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether internal operations (for example, operations that are initiated by plugins) should be logged along with the operations that are requested by users. |  [optional] |
|**correlateRequestsAndResults** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to automatically log result messages for any operation in which the corresponding request was logged. In such cases, the result, entry, and reference criteria will be ignored, although the log-responses, log-search-entries, and log-search-references properties will be honored. |  [optional] |
|**connectionCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of connection criteria that must match the associated client connection in order for a connect, disconnect, request, or result message to be logged. |  [optional] |
|**requestCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of request criteria that must match the associated operation request in order for a request or result to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
|**resultCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of result criteria that must match the associated operation result in order for that result to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
|**searchEntryCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of search entry criteria that must match the associated search result entry in order for that it to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
|**searchReferenceCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of search reference criteria that must match the associated search result reference in order for that it to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
