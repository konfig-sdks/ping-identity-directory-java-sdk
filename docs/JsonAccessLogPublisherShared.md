|**compressionMechanism** | **EnumlogPublisherCompressionMechanismProp** |  |  [optional] |
|**signLog** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the log should be cryptographically signed so that the log content cannot be altered in an undetectable manner. |  [optional] |
|**encryptLog** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether log files should be encrypted so that their content is not available to unauthorized users. |  [optional] |
|**encryptionSettingsDefinitionID** | **String** | Specifies the ID of the encryption settings definition that should be used to encrypt the data. If this is not provided, the server&#39;s preferred encryption settings definition will be used.

|**writeMultiLineMessages** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the JSON objects should be formatted to span multiple lines with a single element on each line. The multi-line format is potentially more user friendly (if administrators may need to look at the log files), but each message will be larger because of the additional spaces and end-of-line markers. |  [optional] |

|**includeThreadID** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether log messages should include the thread ID for the Directory Server in each log message. This ID can be used to correlate log messages from the same thread within a single log as well as generated by the same thread across different types of log files. More information about the thread with a specific ID can be obtained using the cn&#x3D;JVM Stack Trace,cn&#x3D;monitor entry. |  [optional] |

|**includeResultCodeNames** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether result log messages should include human-readable names for result codes in addition to their numeric values. |  [optional] |
|**includeExtendedSearchRequestDetails** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether log messages for search requests should include extended information from the request, including the requested size limit, time limit, alias dereferencing behavior, and types only behavior. |  [optional] |

|**generifyMessageStringsWhenPossible** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to use generified version of certain message strings, including diagnostic messages, additional information messages, authentication failure reasons, and disconnect messages. Generified versions of those strings may use placeholders (like %s for a string or %d for an integer) rather than the version of the string with those placeholders replaced with specific values. |  [optional] |
|**maxStringLength** | **Integer** | Specifies the maximum number of characters that may be included in any string in a log message before that string is truncated and replaced with a placeholder indicating the number of characters that were omitted. This can help prevent extremely long log messages from being written. |  [optional] |

|**logSecurityNegotiation** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to log information about the result of any security negotiation (e.g., SSL handshake) processing that has been performed. |  [optional] |

|**suppressReplicationOperations** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether access messages that are generated by replication operations should be suppressed. |  [optional] |
|**correlateRequestsAndResults** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to automatically log result messages for any operation in which the corresponding request was logged. In such cases, the result, entry, and reference criteria will be ignored, although the log-responses, log-search-entries, and log-search-references properties will be honored. |  [optional] |
|**connectionCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of connection criteria that must match the associated client connection in order for a connect, disconnect, request, or result message to be logged. |  [optional] |
|**requestCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of request criteria that must match the associated operation request in order for a request or result to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
|**resultCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of result criteria that must match the associated operation result in order for that result to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
|**searchEntryCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of search entry criteria that must match the associated search result entry in order for that it to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
|**searchReferenceCriteria** | **String** | Specifies a set of search reference criteria that must match the associated search result reference in order for that it to be logged by this Access Log Publisher. |  [optional] |
