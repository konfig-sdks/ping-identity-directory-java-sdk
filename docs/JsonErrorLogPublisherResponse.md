|**compressionMechanism** | **EnumlogPublisherCompressionMechanismProp** |  |  [optional] |
|**signLog** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the log should be cryptographically signed so that the log content cannot be altered in an undetectable manner. |  [optional] |

|**writeMultiLineMessages** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the JSON objects should be formatted to span multiple lines with a single element on each line.

This ID can be used to correlate log messages from the same thread within a single log as well as generated by the same thread across different types of log files. More information about the thread with a specific ID can be obtained using the cn&#x3D;JVM Stack Trace,cn&#x3D;monitor entry. |  [optional] |
|**generifyMessageStringsWhenPossible** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether to use the generified version of the log message string (which may use placeholders like %s for a string or %d for an integer), rather than the version of the message with those placeholders replaced with specific values that would normally be written to the log. |  [optional] |
