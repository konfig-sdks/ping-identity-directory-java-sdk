Instead of performing a permanent delete of an entry, deleted entries can be retained as soft deleted entries by their entryUUID values and are available for undelete at a later time.

The Directory Server may never accept connections if this setting is too low. If you are unsure which value to use, you can use the number of expected updates within a five second interval. |  [optional] |
|**replicationBacklogCountAlertThreshold** | **Integer** | An alert is sent when the number of outstanding replication changes for the Directory Server has exceeded this threshold for longer than the replication backlog duration alert threshold. |  [optional] |

The order in which the servers are listed indicates the order in which the Directory Server will attempt to use them in the course of sending a message. The first attempt will always go to the server at the top of the list, and servers further down the list will only be used if none of the servers listed above it were able to successfully send the message. |  [optional] |
|**maxSMTPConnectionCount** | **Integer** | The maximum number of SMTP connections that will be maintained for delivering email messages. |  [optional] |
|**maxSMTPConnectionAge** | **String** | The maximum length of time that a connection to an SMTP server should be considered valid. |  [optional] |

|**enableSubOperationTimer** | **Boolean** | Indicates whether the Directory Server should attempt to record information about the length of time required to process various phases of an operation. Enabling this feature may impact performance, but could make it easier to identify potential bottlenecks in operation processing. |  [optional] |
|**maximumShutdownTime** | **String** | Specifies the maximum amount of time the shutdown of Directory Server may take. |  [optional] |
|**networkAddressCacheTTL** | **String** | Specifies the length of time that the Directory Server should cache the IP addresses associated with the names of systems with which it interacts. |  [optional] |
|**networkAddressOutageCacheEnabled** | **Boolean** | Specifies whether the Directory Server should cache the last valid IP addresses associated with the names of systems with which it interacts with when the domain name service returns an unknown host exception. Java may return an unknown host exception when there is unexpected interruption in domain name service so this setting protects the Directory Server from temporary DNS server outages if previous results have been cached. |  [optional] |
|**trackedApplication** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | Specifies criteria for identifying specific applications that access the server to enable tracking throughput and latency of LDAP operations issued by an application. |  [optional] |
|**jmxValueBehavior** | **EnumglobalConfigurationJmxValueBehaviorProp** |  |  [optional] |
|**jmxUseLegacyMbeanNames** | **Boolean** | When set to true, the server will use its original, non-standard JMX MBean names for the monitoring MBeans. These include RDN keys of \&quot;Rdn1\&quot; and \&quot;Rdn2\&quot; instead of the recommended \&quot;type\&quot; and \&quot;name\&quot; keys. This should option should only be enabled for installations that have monitoring infrastructure that depends on the old keys. |  [optional] |
